We decided to create two stories and split each story to tasks:
[ ] As a developer I would like to see an example to a project layout
- [ ] See how JIRA is hadnled in terms of stories and tasks`
- [ ] See how code is split
- [ ] See how to preserve knowledge (docs, ADRS, batches)
- [ ] See how to handle CI using Jenkinsfile
[ ] As a user I would like to be able to login
- [ ] create web client that shows login input and result
- [ ] create server that responds to a hardcoded usernme+password
- [ ] create client unit tests
- [ ] create server unit tests
- [ ] create e2e unit tests
